    Calculates news sentiment scores and aligns them with OHLCV data timestamps.

    This is a placeholder implementation. A full implementation would involve:
    1.  Loading pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, FinBERT) or using an API.
    2.  Processing the text in `news_df[text_col]` to get sentiment scores (e.g., compound, positive, negative).
    3.  Aligning these scores with the `ohlcv_df` timestamps. This typically means for each
        OHLCV bar, aggregating sentiment from news articles published within a defined window
        around the OHLCV bar's timestamp.
    4.  Handling timezone conversions if `news_df` and `ohlcv_df` timestamps are in different timezones.
        (Assume UTC for both for simplicity in placeholder).

    :param ohlcv_timestamp_col: Timestamp column name in ohlcv_df (expected to be index or regular column).
